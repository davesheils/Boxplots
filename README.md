# Boxplots

Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project - November - December 2018

This repository contains an investigation of the boxplot method of data visualisation. The main body of work is contianed in a Jupyter Notebook: [Boxplot](https://github.com/davesheils/Boxplots/blob/master/Boxplots%20Projects.ipynb)


The dataset used for the examples is [SF city Salaries with Gender](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davesheils/Boxplots/master/SF_salary_data_gender.csv). This itself is a modified version of a dataset hosted on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronaldtroncoso20/sf-salaries-extended).



To view and run the python code in this notebook, you must have the [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook installed on your machine. In addition, you must have Python 3.6 installed. These can be installed as a package using the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/).
